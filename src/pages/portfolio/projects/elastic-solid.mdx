**Elastic Solids** is a physics engine extension for Unity designed to simulate deformable volumetric objects
(Soft Body Dynamics). Unlike hollow cloth simulations,
this project models internal pressure and volume conservation using tetrahedral meshes.

Developed as advanced Computer Graphics coursework,
it implements a mass-spring system extended with volumetric
constraints to simulate materials like jelly or flesh realistically.

## Physics Features

The core of the simulation is a custom solver that integrates Newton's laws for thousands of nodes in real-time.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-8">
    <FeatureCard title="Tetrahedral Volumetric Forces" color="cyan">
        Standard springs only maintain edge lengths.
        This solver adds **Volume Conservation Forces** to each tetrahedron,
        preventing the mesh from collapsing or inverting under pressure.
    </FeatureCard>

    <FeatureCard title="Custom TetGen Integration" color="purple">
        Includes a modified C++ build of **TetGen** compiled as a native plugin.
        It parses `.node`, `.ele`, and `.face` files to generate the tetrahedral
        lattice automatically from any standard mesh.
    </FeatureCard>

    <FeatureCard title="Penalty-Based Collisions" color="red">
        Implements continuous collision detection using **Implicit Penalty Methods**.
        It calculates penetration depth and applies a corrective force
        proportional to the intrusion, ensuring stable contacts.
    </FeatureCard>

    <FeatureCard title="Environmental Interaction" color="green">
        The solver accounts for external factors like **Wind Drag** and **Damping Forces**
        to dissipate energy and stabilize the integration.

## Technical Challenges
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-prose my-8">
    <Challenge title="Mesh Generation Pipeline">
        <p slot="challenge">
            Unity uses surface meshes (triangles), but volumetric physics requires a tetrahedral mesh. Manually creating
            these structures is impossible for complex assets.
        </p>
        <div slot="solution">
            I integrated a modified version of **TetGen**, a quality tetrahedral mesh generator. I wrote a custom parser
            that reads the raw ASCII output (`.node`, `.ele`) and reconstructs the topological connectivity graph
            (neighbors, edges, internal springs) inside Unity at runtime[cite: 206, 212].
        </div>
    </Challenge>

    <Challenge title="Integration Instability">
        <p slot="challenge">
            Stiff springs and high forces (like collision penalties) cause explicit integrators to explode (explode to
            infinity) if the time step is too large.
        </p>
        <div slot="solution">
            I implemented a **Sub-stepping** system. The physics solver runs multiple times per visual frame
            (independent of Unity's `Update`), dividing `deltaTime` into smaller, safe increments to maintain numerical
            stability without sacrificing simulation speed[cite: 213].
