**Block Dasher** is a 3D puzzle adventure game developed by the *Slow Heat Index* collective. As the **Core Developer**, my role was to architect the underlying systems that drove the gameplay, enabling the designers to build complex levels without touching code.

The game challenges players to navigate grid-based levels where movement is restricted by a "parity rule" (moving 2 blocks at a time), requiring spatial reasoning to solve environmental puzzles across diverse biomes.

## Engineering the Mechanics

Unlike standard platformers that use Unity's physics engine for movement, Block Dasher required a deterministic, grid-locked movement system to ensure puzzles were solvable and consistent.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-8">
    <FeatureCard title="Custom Grid Physics" color="cyan">
        Implemented a **discrete movement controller** that bypasses standard physics. It handles "hop" animations, grid
        snapping, and collision detection logic based on a virtual coordinate system, not just colliders.
    </FeatureCard>

    <FeatureCard title="The Parity System" color="purple">
        The core mechanic involves changing the player's "step size" (1 vs 2 blocks) dynamically. This required a
        flexible **State Machine** to handle transitions between movement modes without breaking the grid alignment.
    </FeatureCard>

    <FeatureCard title="Level Design Tooling" color="green">
        Developed custom **Unity Editor Inspectors** to help designers tag blocks, set up parity-switchers, and define
        win conditions visually, speeding up the level creation pipeline.
    </FeatureCard>

    <FeatureCard title="Cross-Platform Input" color="orange">
        Abstracted the input layer to support both **Keyboard (WASD)** for PC and **Swipe Gestures** for
        Android/Touchscreens seamlessly.
    </FeatureCard>

## Promotional Website

To maximize reach and accessibility, we decided against relying solely on downloadable binaries.
I built a dedicated **Landing Page** hosted on GitHub Pages that serves as the central hub for the project.

The site was designed to reflect the game's minimal aesthetic and acts
as a press kit, displaying high-resolution renders and the art direction
context that is often lost in a small game window.
